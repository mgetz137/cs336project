We are going to create a site that stores maps and information pertaining to them from Calvin's map room. It will categorize maps by topography, geography, etc. A user would be able to retrieve maps by state, year, and type, and submit new maps.

Our app is deployed on Heroku at https://cs336map.herokuapp.com
