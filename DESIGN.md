For the ReactJS frontend, we're envisioning a straightforward layout with a few buttons for browsing objects in the database, along with a prominently featured logo and header. A search box will be included.

For the database backend we will be using Mongo to store collections of users and maps, with respective individual values and role/admin status.

The maps will be sorted into collections based on type, including:

* Topographic
* Geologic
* Thematic
* Miscellaneous

Further details will include state, year, and publisher.

Users will be organized by unique usernames, ID's (primary key), and role (user, mod, admin, owner).

One of the challenges of this project will be keeping the user collections operating correctly and securely.
